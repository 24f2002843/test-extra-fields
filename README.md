# Static Single Page App

## Overview
This is a simple static single page application designed to demonstrate basic web technologies.

## Features
- Simple UI
- JavaScript functionality to enhance interactivity

## Testing Extra Fields
In this round, we've focused on testing out extra fields to observe if they cause any errors in our application. We dynamically added extra fields to the DOM to ensure they integrate well without issues.

## Getting Started
To run the app, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Future Work
Plans for future updates include enhancing interactivity and refining the UI.

## Additional Information
In this update, we confirmed that adding extra fields does not disrupt existing functionalities and enhances the interactive aspects of the application.

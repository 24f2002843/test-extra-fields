# Static Single-Page Web App

## Overview
This is a minimal static single-page web application designed to demonstrate the usage of JavaScript for testing extra fields in round 2 requests.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the webpage.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the appâ€™s functionality.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `service-worker.js`: A service worker file for caching and offline functionality.
- `LICENSE`: The file containing the legal licensing information.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Ensure you have a local server if necessary to support service workers.

## Updates
### Round 2
In this round, additional fields were tested within the requesting functionality of the application.
